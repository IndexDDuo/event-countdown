# [Event Countdown - React Native Web](http://IndexDDuo.github.io/event-countdown)

> The event countdown mobile app allows the user to create a countdown for events and store the data locally. The user can also use it as a to-do list, but different from a to-do list, it tracks the countdown of upcoming events and to-do “items” and provides the user a visual representation of how much time is left until either an event occurs or something needs to be done
