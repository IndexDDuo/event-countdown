# [Event Countdown - React Native Web](http://IndexDDuo.github.io/event-countdown)

> The event countdown mobile app allows the user to create a countdown for events and store the data locally. The user can also use it as a to-do list, but different from a to-do list, it tracks the countdown of upcoming events and to-do “items” and provides the user a visual representation of how much time is left until either an event occurs or something needs to be done

## Features

- Create new events with name, date, and description
- Mark events as all-day or with a specific time
- Set reminders for events
- View a list of all events and their details
- Delete events

## Demo

Check out the [live demo](http://IndexDDuo.github.io/event-countdown) on GitHub Pages.
